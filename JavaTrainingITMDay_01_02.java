/* Evolution of Programming Languages (Java Perspective):-

Programming languages evolved to make development easier, faster,
and less error-prone. Over time, we moved from hardware-level instructions 
to human-friendly, portable, object-oriented languages like Java.


1. Machine Language (1st Generation)

Era: 1940s–1950s

Written in binary (0s and 1s).

Extremely difficult to write and debug.

Platform-specific.


Example (hypothetical binary instructions):

10110000 01100001
10110010 01100010



2. Assembly Language (2nd Generation)

Era: 1950s

Uses mnemonics (human-readable instructions).

Requires an assembler to translate to machine code.

Still platform-specific.


Example (x86-like assembly):

MOV AX, 1
MOV BX, 2
ADD AX, BX



3. High-Level Languages (3rd Generation)

Era: 1960s onward

Closer to human language, portable, easier to learn.

Examples: C, C++, Java, Python.


C (Procedural)

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}

Portable but not inherently object-oriented.

Platform dependent at compile time (needs recompilation for different OS).


C++ (Object-Oriented Extension of C)

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}

Adds classes, OOP, better abstraction.

Still platform-dependent binaries.


Java — The Big Shift (Mid-1990s)

Developed by: James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (1995).

Tagline: “Write Once, Run Anywhere.”

Key innovation: Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Java code compiles to bytecode.

JVM interprets bytecode on any operating system ? platform-independent.


Fully Object-Oriented (almost everything is a class).

Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection).

Security & Network Support built-in ? ideal for internet-era applications.


Java "Hello, World!"

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}


4. Modern Languages and Beyond

Scripting & dynamic languages: Python, JavaScript ? faster prototyping.

Domain-specific languages: SQL, R, MATLAB ? specialized tasks.

AI-assisted coding & cross-platform frameworks are shaping the future.


Why Java Is Important Today

Enterprise Applications: Most large-scale enterprise systems still use Java.

Android Development: Java was the primary language for Android apps for many years.

Server-Side Development: Spring, Spring Boot dominate back-end Java development.

Community & Libraries: Huge ecosystem, stable, constantly updated.

Performance & Scalability: JVM optimizations make Java very fast and robust.

History of Java Programming Language

Java is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world today. It was developed in the mid-1990s to solve platform-dependency and network-related challenges of existing programming languages.


Timeline of Java

Year        Event

1990        A project called Green Project started by Sun Microsystems to develop software for consumer electronic devices.
1991        A team led by James Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Mike Sheridan, and others began designing a new language. Initially named Oak (after an oak tree outside Gosling’s office).
1993        The rise of the Internet shifted the project’s focus from consumer devices to web technology.
1994        Team realized the potential of this new language for networked, cross-platform applications.
1995        Oak was renamed Java (due to trademark issues — “Oak” was already registered). Sun Microsystems officially released Java 1.0.
1997–1999        Java 1.1 and Java 2 (J2SE, J2EE, J2ME) introduced new APIs, Swing, collections, etc.
2004        Java 5 introduced Generics, Annotations, and enhanced for-loops.
2006        Sun open-sourced Java (OpenJDK project).
2009–2010        Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems and became the official owner of Java.
2011–Present        Regular Java versions released (Java 7, 8, 9, 11, 17, 21, etc.) with major improvements like Lambdas, Streams, Modules, Records, Virtual Threads, etc.


Why the Name “Java”?

Originally called Oak, but the name was already trademarked.

The team brainstormed names; they wanted something short, unique, and dynamic.

“Java” was chosen, inspired by Java coffee — symbolizing energy, liveliness, and simplicity.


Key Goals of Java’s Design

1. Platform Independence — Write Once, Run Anywhere (via JVM).


2. Simple & Familiar — Similar to C/C++ syntax but without complexity (no pointers, simplified memory management).


3. Object-Oriented — Everything revolves around classes and objects.


4. Secure — Built-in runtime checks, bytecode verification.


5. Robust & Portable — Reliable across systems, consistent behavior.


6. Distributed — Designed for networked environments.


7. High Performance — Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation makes it fast.


8. Multi-threaded — Built-in support for concurrent programming.


Major Editions of Java

Edition        Purpose

Java SE (Standard Edition)        Core Java APIs for desktop and server apps.
Java EE (Enterprise Edition)        APIs for large-scale, distributed, enterprise-level applications (now Jakarta EE).
Java ME (Micro Edition)        For mobile and embedded devices (less used today).
JavaFX        Modern GUI framework for desktop applications.


Java Today

Used in web applications, enterprise software, mobile apps (Android), cloud, IoT, Big Data, and AI frameworks.

Maintained by Oracle and the OpenJDK community with a new release every 6 months and Long-Term Support (LTS) versions every few years (e.g., Java 8, 11, 17, 21).

Java Virtual Machine (JVM) — Big Picture:-

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a software-based engine that runs Java programs. It acts as an abstraction layer between your Java code and the actual operating system/hardware.


JVM — Key Responsibilities

1. Loads Java class files (.class) containing bytecode.


2. Verifies bytecode to ensure security and correctness.


3. Executes bytecode instructions by:

Interpreting them directly, or

Compiling them into native machine code (via JIT — Just-In-Time compiler) for speed.



4. Manages memory automatically via:

Heap (objects)

Stack (method calls)

Garbage Collection (removes unused objects)



5. Provides runtime environment — threads, exceptions, security checks, etc.

 Life Cycle (With Example)

Let’s say you write this simple Java program:

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, JVM!");
    }
}

Step 1: Compilation

javac HelloWorld.java

The Java compiler (javac) compiles HelloWorld.java into HelloWorld.class (bytecode).


Step 2: Execution

java HelloWorld

JVM starts and performs the following:


Step        What Happens

1        Class Loader loads HelloWorld.class into memory.
2        Bytecode Verifier checks the bytecode for safety.
3        JVM allocates memory in Heap & Stack.
4        main method is invoked.
5        Bytecode instructions are interpreted or JIT-compiled into native machine code.
6        Output is displayed: Hello, JVM!


JVM vs JRE vs JDK

Term        Meaning        What It Contains

JVM        Java Virtual Machine                Runs Java bytecode.
JRE        Java Runtime Environment        JVM + Core Libraries (required to run Java apps).
JDK        Java Development Kit                JRE + Development Tools (javac, debugger, etc.).


Important JVM Facts

Each OS needs its own JVM implementation, but all JVMs understand the same bytecode.

JVM provides security sandbox (especially useful for applets & downloaded code).

Performance improved over years thanks to JIT compilation and HotSpot optimizations.

Modern JVMs (like HotSpot, OpenJ9, GraalVM) are highly optimized and used beyond Java (Kotlin, Scala, Groovy also run on JVM).

JVM is like a universal machine. Your Java code is converted to bytecode once. The JVM translates that bytecode into real machine instructions on any platform — making Java platform independent, secure, and optimized.
